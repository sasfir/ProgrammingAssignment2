##  Functions to cache the inverse of a matrix.
##########

##  makeCacheMatrix created a list of four functions to get and set the matrix and to 
##  calculate or retrieve the invers.
##  input s should be a matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


##  computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
##  Return the inverse if the cached value is a number

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
